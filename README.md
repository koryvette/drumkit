## DRUMKIT
JS30 challenge  
This was created as part of the JavaScript 30 challenge.  Additional buttons/sounds/images were added to make this site more functional.


## Files Used
Here are the pages included in this site:  

HTML
* index.html (home page)

CSS  
* style.css  

## Funtionality  
The following functionality has been added to this site:

* "data-keys" were used to call sound files when keyboard was pressed
* Javascript was used to call the correct data-key with the matching sound file  
* This site is also available through github/pages using the link below:  
  https://koryvette.github.io/drumkit/  

## Issues  
* Site does not work on mobile devices, as the keyboard isn't available.
* Trying to add functionality that also works with a button press on screen, in addition to keyboard presses.  This would allow mobile device access and also provide another type of user input.
